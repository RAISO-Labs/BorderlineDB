# Notion API testing

Below are some basic notes when setting up the notion API to be used.

1. Use the database property id's and not the names when possible. This is because the properties are going to change and the id's are not going to change.

## Running the server

First, you must run `npm install` to download the dependencies.

Before running the server, you will also need to create a `.env` file.  Please request [mseckykoebel@u.northwestern.edu]() or [robertgoodman2022@u.northwestern.edu]() for the RAISO .env file.
